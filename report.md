# what I have done in the lab:
# I created a repository in github first
# Then I went to VScode and made the 3 files I was required to make, one file was just a simple html file of hello world type.
# Then I was required to deploy these files to github and make commits and branches.

# All in all the lab was aimed at familiarising myself with git and github, knowing the difference and making sure I know how to work with the.
# since its a required skill for all the developers.
