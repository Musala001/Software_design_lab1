what I have done in the lab:
1. I created a repository in github first
2. Then I went to VScode and made the 3 files I was required to make, one file was just a simple html file of hello world type.
3. Then I was required to deploy these files to github and make commits and branches.

All in all the lab was aimed at familiarising myself with git and github, knowing the difference and making sure I know how to work with the.
since its a required skill for all the developers.
